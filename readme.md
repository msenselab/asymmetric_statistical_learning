## Abstract

Static statistical regularities in the placement of targets and salient distractors within the search display can be learned and used to optimize attentional guidance. Whether statistical learning also extends to dynamic regularities governing the placement of targets and distractors on successive trials has been less investigated. Here, we applied the same dynamic cross-trial regularity (one-step shift of the critical item in clock-/counterclockwise direction) either to the target or a distractor, and additionally varied whether the distractor was defined in a different (color) or the same dimension (shape) as the target. We found robust learning of the predicted target location: processing of the target at this (vs. a random) location was facilitated. But we found no evidence of proactive suppression of the predictable distractor location. Facilitation of the anticipated target location was associated with explicit awareness of the dynamic regularity, whereas participants showed no awareness of the distractor regularity. We propose that this asymmetry arises because, owing to the target’s central role in the task set, its location is explicitly encoded in working memory, enabling the learning of dynamic regularities. In contrast, the distractor is not explicitly encoded; so, statistical learning of distractor locations is limited to static regularities.

## Data Structure

There are five subfolders, each contains one independent experiment. 

- Exp. 1: Distractor regularity (Additional singleton paradigm)
- Exp. 1: Target regularity (Additional singleton paradigm)
- Exp. 2: Distractor regularity (Letter search paradigm)
- Exp. 2: Target regularity (Letter search paradigm)
- Pilot: Pilot experiments on distractor regularity (Additional singleton paradigm)

The folder name indicates the manipulation of the dynamic regularity.  Each subfolder contains the experimental `code` (Matlab code / PsychoPy). The raw data are stored in the subfolder `data`, and the experiental sequences in the subfolder `sequences`. Anysis codes are in R and additional analysis with JASP in the subfolder `Analysis with JASP`. Experimental results are stored in `figures`.
